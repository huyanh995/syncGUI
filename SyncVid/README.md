## Setup
Please note that we have tested this code-base in the following environments:
* Ubuntu 18.04 / A Linux-based cluster system (CentOS 7.8)
* Python 3.6 / Python 3.7
* PyTorch 1.5.1

Clone this repository somewhere with:

    git clone git@github.com/psyCHOder/SyncVid.git
    cd SyncVid/

Then from the base directory of this repository, install all dependencies with:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Please note the [PyTorch official installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for setting up the `torch` and `torchvision` packages on your specific system.

You will also need to setup **ffmpeg** for video decoding. On Linux, we recommend installing distribution-specific packages (usually named `ffmpeg`). If necessary, check out the [official download page](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or [compilation instructions](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide).
